## Markdown

***Q6.** Replace the code in the fenced code block with another block of code. You can use some Python code, or you can insert code from a different language -- just change the language indicated so that syntax highlighting still works properly.*

```python
# Python Program to find the area of triangle

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
```

***Q7.** Edit the table so that it matches the first 3 weeks of our class schedule, as given in our [syllabus](https://github.com/odu-cs800-research/public/blob/main/spr22/syllabus.md).*

|Week|Class Date|Topic|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|Jan 11, 13|Course Intro, What's Grad School All About?|
|2|Jan 18, 20|Academic Presence, Research Careers|
|3|Jan 25, 27|Reading Academic Papers|

This is a simple table.  

|Date|Topic|
|:---:|:---:|
|Sep 1, 3|Introduction, What's Vis and Why Do It?|
|Sep 8, 10|Data and Data Cleaning|

## LaTeX and Overleaf

***Q8.** What is the link to view your newly created project? (Under "Anyone with this link can view this project")*
<br/>This is the link to view my newly created project "https://www.overleaf.com/read/sdpksjjgjhpx"

## Responsible Conduct of Research

***Q9.** Include the image in your report in place of the "Growth of the Early Web" image. Make sure to change the description of the image in the report.*
<br/><img src="https://hostingtribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed.jpg"  width = 400/>
<br/>The above figure shows how revenue generated from big data is getting changed from country to country. 


The example figure below shows the growth in the number of websites between 1993 and 1996.  I've used HTML to insert this to show how images can be scaled.  Change the width value as needed so that your image is an appropriate size.

<img src="growth-early-web.png" width=400 />
